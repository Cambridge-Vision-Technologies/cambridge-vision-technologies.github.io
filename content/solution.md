# Our Solution

Our solution is a hardware device and an integrated software platform capable of identifying ocular biomarker for Alzheimer’s Disease in a primary-care setting. It enables operators with minimal training to evaluate whether a patient is currently suffering from early stage Alzheimer’s disease. The technology uses a combination of commodity imaging hardware, computer vision and AI to standardise and stratify the screening of Alzheimer’s Disease.
