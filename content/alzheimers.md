# Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimerâ€™s, the leading cause of Dementia, is a brain disease that destroys the memory and eventually the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. It is the largest single cause of death, with **one in eleven** of us destined to develop it, and this prevalence, combined with its high cost of care means that the US and EU now spends a combined **$580 billion** a year caring for people who suffer from it.
