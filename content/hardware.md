# Hardware

We are developing a retinal imaging headset. This is the world’s first automated, AI based hardware device which builds on the latest research into retinal biomarkers of Alzheimer’s. Unlike existing diagnostic methods, it:

- does not require a trained operator
- is non-invasive
- gives instant results
