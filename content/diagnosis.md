# Diagnosis

Identifying signs of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease at an early-stage (**Mild Cognitive Impairment Stage**) is notoriously difficult. The gold standard test is post-mortem and state-of-the-art biomarker tests are both expensive and invasive (spinal fluid tap or a PET scan). Hence there is an unmet need for biomarker technologies capable of efficient and non-invasive screening of the larger population.
